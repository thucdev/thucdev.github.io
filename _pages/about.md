Nice to meet you, stranger!
Have a good day. I wish you all the best for visiting my blog.

Let’s talk a little bit about myself. My name is Thuc. You can call me William in English.

> With 3 years of experience in backend development and a strong proficiency in Node.js. I have a proven track record of building scalable and efficient applications. I am a highly motivated and results-oriented developer with a passion for clean code and building exceptional user experiences.

> **Backend**: I have experience working with Node.JS, TypeScript, ExpressJS, NestJS, Postgresql, MySQL, DynamoDB, AWS and other technologies.

> **Frontend**: I have experience working with ReactJS (NextJS, Redux Toolkit), Material UI, TailwindCSS, Bootstrap, Axios, and other technologies.

Let's talk a little bit about the past.
I graduated in the fields of Database Administration in 2016. After I graduated, the government called me to go to the army. After I left the army, I spent time learning how to make a full website and I have had a passion for coding from that time.

Now coding is a part of my life. Maybe in the future I can become a Leader, PO, PM or the day AI will replace humans in the technology field, I think I will still spend time coding.

I started this blog for some reason. First of all I want to share and save what I know. Second, I want to track the road I go in the developer life.
Maybe I’m using some stupid grammar or writing some ridiculous thing. No problem. Because this is my blog. Haha.
